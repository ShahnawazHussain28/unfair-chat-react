# Unfair Chat

Unfair Chat is a messaging application.
- **Frontend** made with: ReactJS
- **Backend end** made with: ReactJS, Express, Socket.io

### How to run this?
1. To run this application on your PC first clone the repository. <br/>
  `git clone https://github.com/ShahnawazHussain28/unfair-chat-react.git`
2. Run `node server.js`

You are good to go. The app should be up and running. If any problem occurs you can make an issue or discuss it with me.


# **Why Unfair?**
- Along with all the good features, it has some evil features too.
- You can see in real-time, what the other person is typing before they send the message (or don't send :P).
- You can see whom the other person is talking to. It shows the name and number of the person that the other person is talking to.
- Some messages get altered on the way. Love becomes hate and hate becomes love XD.
- These are enough to start a war and break the relationship with the loved ones.

## Features
- The UI is responsive. Works perfect on PC as well as Android.
- First of all, you have to create an account in order to start chatting. Don't worry it's pretty easy.
- Once you are logged in, you can add a phone number to chat with them (If they have an account with that number)
- You can clear a chat, delete a contact, Log Out, or Delete your account permanently.
- Messages are stored on your browser's local storage and nowhere else.
- Change your profile picture (till now it's an emoji instead of a photo).
- Blue tick or read receipt feature is also present.
- It shows online, last seen or typing status.
- If the person is offline then the messages are stored on the server so that when they come online, they can get those messages.
